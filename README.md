# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

## Description
This command-line application helps project managers build a team by entering basic work information about their employees. This application neatly summarizes the employee information into cards. Although this appears to be a simple application, building this command-line application was a challenge. I used newfound skills such as `inquirer`, `jest`, and `ES6` among others to develop this Team Profile Generator.
